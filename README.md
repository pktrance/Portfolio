# Patrick Tran • Data Analyst / Business Analyst

## ABOUT ME:

I am a **UCLA Statistics** graduate with over a **decade of professional leadership experience**. My background in Creative Direction and Audio Engineering has instilled a deep respect for process optimization and stakeholder communication—skills I now apply to **data-driven business strategy**. I specialize in transforming raw data into actionable insights using **SQL, Python, and Tableau**. Whether I am analyzing **2M+ records** to uncover market trends or building **automated KPI dashboards**, my goal is to provide clarity and drive ROI through rigorous statistical analysis.

## PROJECTS:

### Spotify Catalog Insights

- Analyzed **2M+ music catalog records** to understand relationships between label characteristics and streaming success. Found that **mid-size independent labels** (50-199 albums) achieve **59% higher album popularity** than major labels, and identified winner-take-most dynamics where the **top 5% of artists** generate **4.3x higher engagement**.
